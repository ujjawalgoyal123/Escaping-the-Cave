## Decrypted Text

This is the first chamber of the caves. As you can see, there is nothing of interest in the chamber. Some of the later chambers will be more interesting than this one! The code used for this message is a simple substitution cipher in which digits have been shifted by 14 places. The password is tyRgU69diqq without the quotes.

## Analysis

We used frequency analysis for the letters to figure out the approximate mapping of ciphertext to normal text. Thereafter we tried to correct the mapping by trial and error method to see if words make sense by changing something. Then we got the correct mapping of letters. Now for the numbers, our approach was caesar cipher. After correcting the spacing, the text was 14 places shifted.
But in the text it was written 8 places. So we came to the conclusion that digits were shifted by 6. This is how we obtained the desired result.
